# Daily LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my daily solutions to LeetCode problems, written primarily in **C++**.

The main goal of this repository is to build **consistency** in problem solving while improving algorithmic thinking and code quality over time.

---

## 📌 Goals

- Solve **at least one LeetCode problem every day**
- Focus on **consistency over perfection**
- Document problem-solving approaches clearly
- Revisit and **optimize solutions** when possible

---

## 🛠 Language

- **C++** (primary)

Additional languages may be added in the future once the core problem-solving approach is solid.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Problems are organized by **year** and **month**:

```text
2026/
 ├── 01-January/
 │   ├── 0001-two-sum.cpp
 │   ├── 0121-best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock.cpp
 │   └── README.md
 ├── 02-February/
```


Each problem solution includes:
- Problem number and name
- Date solved
- Difficulty
- A brief explanation of the approach
- Time and space complexity

---

## 🧠 Notes on Solutions

- Some solutions may start with a **brute-force approach**.
- Solutions may be **refined or optimized later**.
- The focus is on steady improvement, not perfect solutions from day one.

---

## 📖 Disclaimer

These solutions are written for **learning and practice purposes**.  
If you are currently solving a LeetCode problem, try to work on it yourself before referring to any solution here.
